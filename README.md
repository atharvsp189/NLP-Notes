# NLP Notes: Text Preprocessing, Encoding, and Word Embeddings

This repository explores various techniques for text preprocessing, encoding, and word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find implementations that prepare textual data for machine learning tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and more.

## Overview

* **Text Preprocessing:** Techniques to clean, normalize, and feature-engineer textual data for better model performance.
* **Encoding:** Methods to convert textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
* **Word Embeddings:** Techniques to map words into dense vector spaces, capturing semantic relationships between words.

## Implementation

The code within this repository focuses on Python implementations of various NLP techniques. Scripts demonstrating these techniques are likely provided within the repository (adjust as needed).

**Potential Techniques Covered (customize with specific implementations):**

* **Text Cleaning:**
    * Removing noise (special characters, punctuation, stop words)
    * Lowercasing text
    * Handling abbreviations and slang
    * Normalizing text
        * Stemming
        * Lemmatization 
* **Encoding:**
    * One-hot encoding
    * Bag of Words
    * TF-IDF
* **Word Embeddings:**
    * Word2Vec (CBOW and Skip-gram)
